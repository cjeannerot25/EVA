# EVA MGN Carriage Platform


![](https://github.com/pkucmus/EVA/blob/master/images/lineup.png)

I present to you the EVA carriage platform - easy to mount, remix and use MGN carriages for different Hotend assemblies.

They work great with the [Rat Rig V-core Pro](https://www.ratrig.com/3d-printing-cnc/3d-printer-kits/complete-kits/rat-rig-v-core-pro-linear-rail-701.html) "Easy mod" I created: https://github.com/pkucmus/Easy-Mod

A rather poor attempt to talk about those: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR8LTCniA766Mg1a88iF8xhOlvZR-Rc3A
