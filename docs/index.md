## Platform

EVA is a platform for ==MGN12 and MGN15== rail based 3D Printer carriages. Mainstream support fouses on [Rat Rig](https://www.ratrig.com/) 3D printers but it's customizable enough to support different systems.

Rather lenghty video descriptions can be found on [the YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR8LTCniA766Mg1a88iF8xhOlvZR-Rc3A).

## Download

This manual is full of links to specific parts, {==**but there is no need to download those one by one**==} the full repository can be **[downloaded as a ZIP file](https://github.com/pkucmus/EVA/archive/master.zip)**.

## Examples

For Rat Rig V-core Pro the [Easy Mod](https://github.com/pkucmus/Easy-Mod) is required to change the X and Y rail orientation.

## Contribution

Issues, problems, feature requests, requests for compatibility with different printers can be requested in the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/pkucmus/EVA/issues).

## Attributions

One does not need a keen eye to see that this design it's based on many different designs that are out in the wild - although all the parts here are made from scratch - their authors deserve credit (their work provided inspiration):

* [Rat Rig](https://www.ratrig.com/) for making the V-core which is the perfect sanbox for building and modding a 3D Printer
